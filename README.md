# BuyNest E-commerce Admin Panel 📱

## Overview

The **BuyNest E-commerce Admin Panel** is a Windows application built using the Flutter framework, designed to manage the BuyNest e-commerce platform’s user-facing mobile app. This admin panel empowers business owners to oversee and control key aspects of their online store, including categories, subcategories, brands, variants, variant types, and products. With a robust interface, it supports adding, updating, deleting, and managing all fields displayed on the user side, ensuring seamless store administration. 

This project integrates a **Node.js** backend with a **MongoDB** database, demonstrating my skills in full-stack development—combining Flutter’s cross-platform UI capabilities with backend logic and data management.
